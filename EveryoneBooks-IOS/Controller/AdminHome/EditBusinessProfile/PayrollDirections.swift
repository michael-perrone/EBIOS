If they are paid by comission, you will be asked to input the percentage of comission they make off each service and product. You can come back at anytime and change this information. Please remember to save each employees information hitting the save button at the bottom of the payroll setup page. After you are done entering all of your employees information hit the finish up button below to enter some final details about how you would like your payroll to be conducted.", color: .mainLav);
